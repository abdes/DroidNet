Reviewing RenderGraphBuilder shows a single, stateful, side‑effect heavy “god method” (Build()) orchestrating many orthogonal concerns (configuration, expansion, optimization, validation, scheduling, lifetime & alias analysis, diagnostics, cache key emission). Below are 5 high‑impact, high‑value refactorings (kept to the requested max) that decompose responsibilities, raise testability, and open clear seams for performance tuning—while preserving external behavior.

1. Phase Pipeline Decomposition (Build Orchestration → GraphBuildPipeline)
Goal: Replace the monolithic Build() with a composable, testable pipeline of immutable phase objects.

Key ideas:

Introduce lightweight interfaces (pure value / stateless where possible):
IBuildPhase { virtual PhaseResult run(BuildContext&) = 0; }
Concrete phases: ViewConfigPhase, PerViewExpansionPhase, PromotionPhase, ValidationPhase, SchedulingPhase, LifetimeAliasPhase, DependencyRemapPhase, FinalizePhase.
BuildContext aggregates only the mutable working sets (resources, passes, mappings, diagnostics) plus injected collaborators (validator, scheduler, alias validator, profiler).
RenderGraphBuilder::Build() reduces to constructing BuildContext, then iterating a constexpr std::array of phases with std::ranges::for_each.
Phase outputs can use std::expected<void, PhaseError> enabling early termination + precise error localization.
Unit tests can now exercise each phase with synthetic inputs (e.g. feed malformed dependency sets only to ValidationPhase).
Enables future parallelization (some phases are read-only after prior commits) and targeted profiling (timing per phase) without touching core logic.
C++20/23 leverage:

std::expected, std::ranges, std::move_only_function (for phase callbacks if customization needed).
constexpr array of phase singletons; phases can be final and trivially constructible.
Benefits:

SRP & Open/Closed: add a new optimization by inserting a phase.
Sharply improved test granularity (mock scheduler / validator).
Smaller translation units → faster incremental builds.


2. Per‑View Management Module (PerViewResourceManager & PerViewPassExpander)
Goal: Isolate all “per-view” cloning, mapping, and handle remapping currently scattered across ProcessViewConfiguration, CreatePerViewResources, CreatePerViewPasses, RemapResourceHandlesForView, and OptimizeSharedPerViewResources.

Key ideas:

New component PerViewExpansionService with contract:
analyze_views(frame_views, filters) -> ActiveViewSet
expand_resources(registry, ActiveViewSet)
expand_passes(pass_registry, ActiveViewSet, executor_share_policy)
promote_read_only_duplicates(registry, pass_usages)
Maintain internal compact structures:
flat_vector<PerViewVariant<ResourceHandle>> (vector of POD structs) rather than multiple unordered_maps for better cache locality.
Provide a pure function for the promotion heuristic accepting spans of usages so it is fuzz-testable.
Executor sharing: wrap the base executor in std::shared_ptr<std::move_only_function<...>> centrally instead of ad hoc inside builder.
Benefits:

DRY: One pathway for mapping (removes repeated loops & logging branches).
Deterministic memory patterns; easier instrumentation of per-view cost.
Enables targeted tests: “Given N views and M resources, promotion reduces duplicates”.


3. Strongly Typed Registries with Contiguous Storage & Deterministic Ordering
Goal: Replace unordered_map-based handle → descriptor/pass storage with contiguous vectors plus indirection, improving iteration speed, deterministic cache keys, and simplifying lifetime analysis.

Key ideas:

Introduce ResourceId / PassId strong types (thin wrappers around uint32_t) with explicit invalid sentinel.
Registries:
class ResourceRegistry { std::vector<ResourceDescPtr> resources; }
class PassRegistry { std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RenderPass>> passes; }
Provide O(1) lookup by index; maintain a free list if deletions expected.
Maintain a separate std::pmr::unordered_map<ResourceHandle, ResourceId> only if external stable handle indirection is required; otherwise treat handle == index.
Deterministic traversal order → stable hashing for cache key; drop need for recomputing after unordered_map iteration order changes.
Lifetime/alias analysis can precompute per-pass resource read/write bitsets (packed into std::uint64_t groups) enabling branchless hazard scanning.
Replace manual next_*_id_ with vector size (or free list pop).
C++23 leverage:

std::expected<ResourceId, CreateError> for creation.
std::pmr::vector / std::pmr::unordered_map to allow arena allocation per frame, then a single monotonic_buffer_resource reset.
Ranges: std::ranges::transform to build lists (e.g., resource handles) without manual loops.
Benefits:

Faster hot loops (cache-friendly, predictable).
Simpler reasoning in tests (index-based golden expectations).
Deterministic hashing eliminates flaky cache invalidation.


4. Structured Diagnostics & Validation Abstraction
Goal: Convert scattered LOG_F statements and ad hoc error pushing into a central, structured diagnostics channel that validators and phases can publish to.

Key ideas:

struct Diagnostic { enum class Kind { Info, Warning, Error }; enum class Code { MismatchedReadStates, AliasHazard, ... }; std::string_view message; SmallVector<PassHandle,4> related_passes; };
DiagnosticsSink interface (default logs to loguru; tests capture to vector).
Validators return ValidationReport { std::vector<Diagnostic>, bool is_valid() } instead of mutating builder state directly.
Hazards, promotion notices, and phase timing all go through sink.
Optional JSON emitter for offline tooling (frame debug capture).
Replace string concatenation hotspots with fmt (if already used) or preformatted templates; keep message allocation within a PMR resource when possible.
C++23 leverage:

std::expected<void, ValidationReport> or a composite object containing both validation details and partial artifacts.
std::string_view & constexpr tables for diagnostic code → human text mapping.
std::source_location for debug severity injection (cheap context in logs).
Benefits:

Test harness can assert “no AliasHazard::Error diagnostics emitted”.
Cleaner production logging (severity filtering).
Facilitates future live UI integration (editor showing graph issues).

5. Pluggable Optimization & Analysis Strategies
Goal: Decouple optimization logic (shared resource promotion, multi-queue scheduling tweaks, future transient alias packing) from core builder, enabling selective enable/disable and A/B testing.

Key ideas:

Strategy interfaces:
struct IGraphOptimization { virtual void apply(BuildContext&, DiagnosticsSink&) = 0; };
struct IAnalysisPass { virtual void run(BuildContext&, AnalysisResults&) = 0; };
Default strategy set registered in builder (vector of pointers or move-only functions). Advanced users (or tests) can inject mock / minimal strategies to isolate behavior.
Move existing OptimizeSharedPerViewResources into SharedReadOnlyPromotionStrategy.
Encapsulate lifetime + alias analysis steps into AliasLifetimeAnalysis object with explicit inputs (pass order, usages) and outputs (interval table, hazard list) returned as value types.
Scheduling enhancements (multi-queue optimization) becomes a strategy chained after base scheduler result, enabling future heuristics (critical path shortening, pass fusion).
Graph cache key generation also becomes a strategy so hashed features can evolve without central edits.
C++23 leverage:

std::move_only_function<void(BuildContext&, DiagnosticsSink&)> where concrete class overhead is unnecessary.
Use if consteval (for compile-time strategy toggles in specialized builds if desired).
std::span for passing resource/pass arrays without copying.
Benefits:

SOLID: builder open for extension, closed for modification.
Easier benchmarking and toggling optimizations (flag-based).
Clear injection points for performance experiments (e.g., alternative alias packers).
Suggested Implementation Order (High ROI First)
Phase Pipeline (unlocks clean seams for the rest).
Per-View Manager extraction (shrinks complexity hotspot).
Strongly typed registries & contiguous storage (performance + determinism).
Structured diagnostics (test visibility & cleanliness).
Optimization/Analysis strategy plug-in system (future scalability).
Each step can be merged independently with minimal risk if guarded by internal feature flags (start with parity mode). Maintain exhaustive regression tests around: pass count, resource count, execution order, cache key stability, validation diagnostics equivalence.

Let me know if you’d like a concrete skeleton (headers/interfaces) for any of these and I can draft it next.
