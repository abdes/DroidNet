# ðŸ“˜ Nexus Working Design Document

## 1. Introduction

**Nexus** is the Unified GPU Resource Manager (UGRM) and the orchestration point
for ScenePrep Finalization. It is the authoritative gatekeeper for GPU
residency: it decides what enters the GPU, what remains resident, and what gets
evicted. Nexus is bindless-first, batch-oriented, and supports both GPU-backed
and CPU-only configurations. Finalization priority and upload order are
deterministic: transforms â†’ materials â†’ geometry â†’ textures.

## 2. âœ… Struct Layout and Naming Semantics

This section defines the rules for struct design, naming, and validation within
Nexus. The goal is to ensure absolute consistency between CPU and GPU
representations, maintain semantic clarity across the codebase, and enable
futureâ€‘proof extensibility.

### 2.1 Alignment Rules and Crossâ€‘Language Consistency

All GPUâ€‘facing data structures must have a stable binary layout across **C++**,
**HLSL**, and **GLSL**.

- **Alignment Targets**
  - Vectors (`float4`, `int4`): 16â€‘byte alignment minimum.
  - Root constants / CBVs (D3D12): 256â€‘byte alignment per hardware constant
    buffer requirements.
  - SSBOs / UAVs: Use `std430`â€‘like packing for Vulkan/GLSL to avoid unexpected
    padding. For D3D12, follow its alignment rules, which are similar but not
    identical to `std430`.

- **Size Enforcement**
  - Apply `static_assert(sizeof(T) % 16 == 0)` to all GPUâ€‘facing structs.
  - Use `alignas(16)` or higher where required to match shader expectations.

- **Binary Layout Identification**
  - At build time, generate a `LayoutId` hash for each GPUâ€‘facing struct.
  - Embed the hash in both shader and C++ definitions.
  - Validate at runtime (debug builds only) to detect ABI mismatches before
    rendering.

- **Platform Notes**
  - Pad explicitly to account for platform or compiler ABI quirks.
  - Keep layouts endianâ€‘safe if data will be serialized or streamed
    crossâ€‘platform.

### 2.2 Root Constants vs. Descriptor Tables

Define a strict separation between lightweight root constants and bindless
descriptor resources. The `RenderPass` base class enforces this separation
across all passes, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.

- **Root Constants**
  - Used for small, frequently updated values (e.g., frame constants, draw
    indices).
  - The `kDrawIndexConstant` is a key example, used to bind per-draw indices
    efficiently.
  - The `RenderPass` base class ensures root constants are bound correctly
    before each draw call.

- **Descriptor Tables**
  - All buffers, textures, and samplers live in bindless descriptor tables.
  - Descriptor tables are bound in the root signature and accessed via shaders.
  - The `RenderPass` base class enforces the use of descriptor tables for SRVs,
    ensuring stable descriptor ranges and efficient GPU access patterns.

#### Binding Discipline

- Keep descriptor ranges stable across frames to minimize driver work.
- Separate per-frame constants from per-draw constants in distinct root slots.
- The `RenderPass` base class validates root signature layouts and ensures
  alignment with the Nexus binding model.

### 2.3 Semantic Naming Conventions

Type and member names must communicate **role**, **lifetime**, and **scope**
unambiguously.

- **Prefixes**
  - `Gpu*` â†’ GPUâ€‘facing structures mirrored in shaders.
  - `*Handle` â†’ Bindless index into a GPU resource table.
  - `*Id` â†’ Immutable registry identifier or asset key.
  - `*View` â†’ Transient, readâ€‘only view of a resource.
- **Suffixes**
  - `Buffer`, `Texture`, `Sampler`, `Table` to indicate resource type
    explicitly.
- **Guidelines**
  - Avoid abbreviations in public or shared headers.
  - Use consistent terminology between CPU and GPU code for equivalent data.

### 2.4 Validation and Enforcement

Automated validation ensures struct safety and semantic correctness throughout
the pipeline.

- **Static Analysis**
  - static_assert when applicable to enforce contracts at compile time.
  - Clangâ€‘Tidy rules enforce naming patterns and banned abbreviations.
- **Buildâ€‘Time Checks**
  - Generated tooling compares struct fields and offsets against shader
    reflection data.
  - CI fails on any mismatch.
- **Runtime Debugging**
  - Optional debug pass in the first draw validates `LayoutId` matches. Enabled
    only in debug builds to avoid performance overhead.
  - Logs show expected vs. actual layout hash, plus offending struct details.

### 2.5 Bestâ€‘Practice Considerations

- **Forward/Backward Compatibility**
  - Use version tags for structs that may evolve.
  - Retain deprecated fields until all dependent shaders are updated. Delete
    them as soon as the shaders are migrated.
- **Cache Behavior**
  - Cluster hot fields for coherent access; move cold fields to the end.
- **Serialization**
  - Match onâ€‘disk or streamed layouts to GPU layout when possible to avoid
    costly repacking.
- **Crossâ€‘Compiler Safety**
  - Run startup layout verification shaders to detect compiler/driver packing
    deviations.

## 3. Bindless Indices Management

Nexus provides a unified, stable indexing system for all GPUâ€‘visible resources
to support a bindlessâ€‘first rendering model. The system guarantees that any
shaderâ€‘visible index remains valid for the lifetime of its resource and prevents
aliasing between active and freed slots.

### 3.1 Global Indexing Scheme

- Maintain a **unified descriptor heap** for all resource types (SRV/UAV/CBV),
  as required by D3D12.
- Logical segmentation is achieved through descriptor ranges within a single
  descriptor table at root parameter 0.
  - Range 0: A single CBV at register `b1` (heap index 0).
  - Range 1: Unbounded SRVs at register `t0`, space0 (heap indices 1+).
- The flag `D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_CBV_SRV_UAV_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED` enables
  direct indexing into the descriptor heap.
- All shaders reference resources via stable indices provided by the allocator.
- Indices are **stable** for the lifetime of an object.
- Reuse occurs **only** after a **generation counter** increment to detect stale
  references.
- The allocator ensures efficient resource management and stable indexing
  without requiring physically separate tables.

### SSoT: `Spec.yaml` (authoritative)

The single source-of-truth for bindless slot/register mapping is
`src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/Spec.yaml`. Key facts taken from that file:

- Domains and domain bases:
  - `scene` (CBV) : register `b1`, heap index 0, domain_base=0, capacity=1
  - `srv_global` (SRV) : register `t0, space0`, domain_base=1, capacity=2048
  - `materials` (SRV) : register `t1, space0`, domain_base=2049, capacity=3047
  - `textures` (SRV) : register `t2, space0`, domain_base=5096, capacity=65536
  - `samplers` (SAMPLER) : register `s0, space0`, domain_base=0, capacity=256

- Heaps (mirror D3D12 allocator defaults):
  - `heap_cbv_srv_uav_cpu` (index 0, cpu-only)
  - `heap_cbv_srv_uav_gpu` (index 1, shader-visible)
  - `heap_sampler_cpu` (index 2, cpu-only)
  - `heap_sampler_gpu` (index 3, shader-visible)
  - `heap_rtv_cpu` (index 4, cpu-only)
  - `heap_dsv_cpu` (index 5, cpu-only)
  - Note: These heaps are configured at runtime from a generated JSON spec
    embedded in `Generated.Heaps.D3D12.h` and loaded by
    `D3D12HeapAllocationStrategy` (see Section 3.7). The generator derives this
    JSON from `Spec.yaml` to keep CPU, tooling, and shaders in sync.

- Mappings tie domains â†’ heaps and provide local base indices. The generator
  consumes this file and emits `BindingSlots.h`, `BindingSlots.hlsl` and a
  runtime JSON descriptor used by the engine/tooling. The JSON is embedded in
  `src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/Generated.Heaps.D3D12.h` as
  `kD3D12HeapStrategyJson` and consumed by
  `D3D12HeapAllocationStrategy::InitFromJson(...)`.

### 3.2 Index Lifetime, Reuse, and Aliasing Prevention

- Use a **32â€‘bit packed handle**:
  `{ index (low bits), generation (high bits) }`
- **Shaderâ€‘visible index** = lower bits (`index`), stored in draw/dispatch data.
- **Generation tracking**:
  - A CPUâ€‘side debug shadow map records the generation for each slot.
  - At validation time, compares current generation with handleâ€™s generation.
- **Sentinel values**:
  - Reserve only `oxygen::engine::kInvalidBindlessIndex` (equal to
    `std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()`) for invalid handles. `0` is a valid
    index.
  - Shaders must safely handle invalid indices by branching to default
    resources.
- **Deferred slot reuse**:
  - Slots freed midâ€‘frame are recycled only after GPU fences confirm no
    inâ€‘flight references.

```cpp
// Strongly typed 32â€‘bit shaderâ€‘visible handle
using BindlessHandle = oxygen::NamedType<uint32_t, struct _BindlessHandleTag>;
```

### 3.3 Shader Contract Integration and Validation

- **Contract**:
  - All shaders access resources via **bindless global indices**.
  - Root constants and descriptor tables are validated and managed by the
    `RenderPass` base class.
  - Passes like `DepthPrePass` and `ShaderPass` inherit these best practices,
    ensuring consistent shader access to resources.

- **Pipeline Initialization Checks**:
  - Validate descriptor heap sizes match Nexus configuration.
  - Verify root signature layouts against Nexus binding model.
  - Emit a clear failure if any shader requests an index outside the configured
    range.

### 3.4 Debugging Strategies for Index Mismatches

- **Optional Validation Layer**:
  - Validate the binding of root constants and descriptor tables during pipeline
    initialization.
  - Ensure that `kDrawIndexConstant` and descriptor tables are correctly set up
    before execution.

### 3.5 Additional Considerations

- **Thread Safety**:
  - Allocation/free operations must be lockâ€‘free or fineâ€‘grained locked for
    Phaseâ€¯2 parallel uploads.
- **Streaming Scenarios**:
  - Consider preâ€‘allocating index ranges for streaming systems to minimize
    contention.
- **Type Safety**:
  - Distinguish index types at compile time (e.g., `TextureHandle` vs
    `BufferHandle`) to prevent crossâ€‘table misuse.
- **Future Extension**:
  - Potential move to typeâ€‘erased unified resource table with runtime type
    tagging.

### 3.6 Implementation status & TODO (bindless indices management)

The codebase contains foundational pieces for bindless rendering (descriptor
allocator, D3D12 root-signature flags, single-table usage), but several items
are missing to fully meet Section 3â€™s contract around stable indices,
lifetime/generation, validation, and type safety.

- [x] Bindless mapping specification and single source-of-truth
  - Action: Specify the bindless slot/register mapping once and generate headers
    for both C++ and HLSL:
    - Align authoritative slot mapping to `b1` for `SceneConstants` across code
      and shaders (remove lingering `b0`).
    - Add/update a single source-of-truth header for symbolic slots and domain
      base indices; consume it from renderer and shaders.
    - Implement a small generator that emits
      `src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/BindingSlots.h` (C++) and
      `src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/BindingSlots.hlsl` (HLSL) from one definition;
      include invalid sentinel and optional domain bases.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.h/.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Renderer/Renderer.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Shaders/FullScreenTriangle.hlsl`,
    `src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/BindingSlots.h`,
    `src/Oxygen/Core/Bindless/BindingSlots.hlsl`, small build/tooling glue.

- [ ] Unified direct indexing flags (CBV/SRV/UAV + Sampler)
  - Status: Partial. CBV/SRV/UAV direct indexing flag is set in D3D12 paths;
    sampler direct indexing appears supported in utilities but isnâ€™t
    consistently propagated across all created root signatures.
  - Action: Ensure all graphics/compute root signatures set both flags:
    D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_CBV_SRV_UAV_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED and
    D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_SAMPLER_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED. Add a debug-time
    assertion at pipeline creation that verifies flags match Section 3.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/CommandRecorder.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Detail/PipelineStateCache.cpp`, any
    pass-specific root signature builders under `src/Oxygen/Renderer/*Pass.cpp`.

- [x] Single shader-visible heap + descriptor table binding discipline
  - Status: Partial. Command recorder binds descriptor heaps and a single
    unbounded SRV descriptor table (t0, space0). The `Spec.yaml` SSoT
    now defines domain bases and mappings; generator emits headers that make
    it possible to validate bindings at startup. Further work: enforce at
    `RenderPass` level and add explicit sampler-table checks.
  - Action: In `RenderPass::Execute`, bind the CBV/SRV/UAV heap and the sampler
    heap exactly once per pass begin (bind-on-change later). Validate that the
    SRV table (t0, space0) and sampler table are set before any draw/dispatch.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/CommandRecorder.*`.

- [ ] Stable global indices: domain bases and capacity budgeting
  - Status: Missing. Need explicit domain base indices
    (geometry/materials/textures/samplers) and capacity accounting to compute
    shader-visible index = base + slot.
  - Action: Add allocator APIs to query/define per-domain base indices and
    reserve capacities:
    - `GetDomainBaseIndex(ResourceViewType, DescriptorVisibility)`
    - `Reserve(ResourceViewType, DescriptorVisibility, uint32_t count)`
    - Ensure `GetRemainingDescriptorsCount(...)` is public for budgeting.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/DescriptorAllocator.h`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Bindless/DescriptorAllocator.cpp`.

- [ ] BindlessHandle type and invalid sentinel
  - Status: Missing. Code uses `DescriptorHandle` for heap slots; no
    strongly-typed 32-bit shader-visible `BindlessHandle` or engine-level
    `kInvalidBindlessIndex` sentinel.
  - Action: Introduce `using BindlessHandle = oxygen::NamedType<uint32_t, struct
    _BindlessHandleTag>;` and define `oxygen::engine::kInvalidBindlessIndex =
    std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()`; ensure 0 is a valid index. Use this
    handle across renderer/scene-prep draw metadata and shader-facing bindings.
  - Files: new header (e.g., `src/Oxygen/Renderer/Binding/BindlessHandle.h`),
    usages in `src/Oxygen/Renderer/ScenePrep/*`, `src/Oxygen/Renderer/*`.

- [ ] Generation tracking and shadow map (aliasing prevention)
  - Status: Missing. No per-slot generation counters or CPU-side shadow map to
    detect stale handles.
  - Action: Add `VersionedBindlessHandle { BindlessIndex index; Generation
    generation; }` on CPU. Maintain a shadow map in the registry from slot â†’
    current generation. On handle use (draw submission), compare generations in
    debug; on mismatch, skip/downgrade draw and log. Increment generation when a
    slot is recycled.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/ResourceRegistry.h/.cpp`, renderer
    submission code under `src/Oxygen/Renderer/*`.

- [ ] Deferred slot reuse with GPU fences
  - Status: Missing. Freed slots can alias in-flight references without
    fence-aware recycling.
  - Action: Implement `ReleaseSlot(handle)` that marks the slot PendingEvict and
    recycles only after the associated fence has completed. Store
    `pending_fence` in slot metadata. Integrate with renderer frame fences.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/ResourceRegistry.h/.cpp`, renderer/frame
    sync in `src/Oxygen/Renderer/Renderer.cpp` (or coordinator/maestro).

- [ ] Startup validation: heap sizes, ranges, and out-of-bounds protection
  - Status: Missing. No automatic check that configured descriptor capacities
    and root signature ranges match Section 3 layout; no bounds check before
    publishing indices.
  - Action: Add debug-time startup validation that: (a) heap capacities cover
    configured domains, (b) root signature ranges are present, and (c) any
    shader-visible index falls within [base, base+capacity). Fail fast with
    clear logs.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.*`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Detail/PipelineStateCache.cpp` (during root
    signature creation), small validator under `src/Oxygen/Renderer/`.

- [ ] Shader invalid-sentinel handling and fallbacks
  - Status: Mixed. Shaders use bindless tables; explicit invalid-sentinel branch
    and default resources are not consistently enforced.
  - Action: Define a shared sentinel in shader headers; ensure all shaders
    branch to defaults when the handle equals `kInvalidBindlessIndex`. Provide
    default resources (white/black textures, null buffers) and keep them
    permanently resident.
  - Files: shader includes under `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Shaders/`,
    shared binding header.

- [ ] Type-safe handle wrappers per resource category
  - Status: Missing. Cross-table misuse prevention (e.g., TextureHandle vs
    BufferHandle) not enforced at compile time.
  - Action: Add lightweight `NamedType<uint32_t, Tag>` wrappers for texture,
    buffer, sampler indices. Conversions to/from `BindlessHandle` are explicit.
    Use in draw metadata and scene-prep.
  - Files: new header (e.g., `src/Oxygen/Renderer/Binding/ResourceHandles.h`),
    updates in `ScenePrep` and passes.

- [ ] Thread-safety and streaming pre-allocation
  - Status: Partial. Allocator segments use mutexes; no per-domain pre-reserved
    index ranges for streaming systems.
  - Action: For Phase 1, use fine-grained locks per domain in the
    registry/allocator; add an optional API to pre-reserve contiguous index
    ranges for high-churn streaming domains to minimize contention.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/DescriptorAllocator.h`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/ResourceRegistry.h`.

- [ ] Optional validation layer toggles
  - Status: Missing. No runtime toggles to enable/disable validation of indices
    and bindings.
  - Action: Add debug-only configuration (env var or engine flag) to enable:
    generation checks, heap/range checks, and root-binding validation during
    pipeline init and first draw.
  - Files: small config in `src/Oxygen/Renderer/`, plumbed through `RenderPass`
    and `ResourceRegistry`.

- [ ] Tests for indices, generation, and recycling
  - Status: Missing.
  - Action: Add unit tests for: allocate/release with generation increment;
    deferred recycling after fences; bounds validation; typed-handle misuse
    (compile-time/static-assert where applicable). Include simple integration
    test that publishes indices into a mock draw and verifies shader index
    bounds.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/Test/`, `src/Oxygen/Renderer/tests`
    (new).

## 4. Logical Structuring of the Unified Descriptor Heap

The unified descriptor heap in Nexus is designed to accommodate all GPU-visible
resources required for rendering, including vertex buffers, index buffers,
structured buffers, material constants, and transform data. Logical segmentation
within the heap ensures efficient resource management and compatibility with the
bindless rendering model.

### 4.1 Descriptor Ranges and Logical Tables

The unified descriptor heap in Nexus is logically segmented into descriptor
ranges, each serving a specific purpose. These ranges ensure efficient resource
management and compatibility with the bindless rendering model. Below is a
detailed breakdown of each range, along with real-world scenarios from game
engine development:

- **Range 0: Constant Buffers (CBV)** (Completed)
  - **Register**: `b1`
  - **Heap Index**: 0
  - **Usage**: Stores per-frame constants, such as scene-wide parameters, or
    fallback constants for legacy systems. Additionally, it holds the **bindless
    indices table**, which is critical for accessing all other resources in the
    unified descriptor heap. The `SceneConstants` buffer is updated dynamically
    in Oxygen, ensuring that renderer-managed fields are refreshed every frame
    and uploaded to the GPU only when changes occur.
  - **Example**: In Oxygen, this range holds the `SceneConstants` buffer, which
    includes the view matrix, projection matrix, and camera position. The
    **bindless indices table** is used by Oxygen's shaders to dynamically fetch
    resources like material constants, textures, and structured buffers. This
    design ensures efficient resource access and eliminates the need for
    frequent CPU-GPU synchronization for resource bindings.

- **Range 1: Shader Resource Views (SRV)** (Completed)
  - **Register**: `t0`, space0
  - **Heap Indices**: 1+
  - **Usage**: Allocated for structured buffers essential for geometry
    processing, such as vertex buffers, index buffers, and transform data.
  - **Example**: When rendering a complex 3D model, the vertex buffer
    (containing positions, normals, and texture coordinates) and the index
    buffer (defining the mesh topology) are stored in this range. These buffers
    are accessed by the vertex shader to transform vertices into screen space.

- **Range 2: Material Constants (domain within SRV t0)** (Partial)
  - **Register**: `t0`, space0 (unified SRV table; addressed via a domain base
    index)
  - **Heap Indices**: Occupies slots inside the unified SRV table starting at
    the materials domain base.
  - **Usage**: Stores per-material data (base color, roughness, flags, etc.) in
    a SoA/packed structured buffer. Materials are indexed by material ID and
    fetched bindlessly by shaders. Materials generally have different residency
    and update characteristics from textures, so keeping them separate at the
    index-space level (via domain bases) helps eviction and upload policies.

- **Range 3: Textures (domain within SRV t0)** (Partial)
  - **Register**: `t0`, space0 (unified SRV table; addressed via a domain base
    index)
  - **Heap Indices**: Dynamically allocated for texture SRVs (per-texture
    descriptors / shader views) within the unified SRV table, starting at the
    textures domain base.
  - **Usage**: Stores GPU texture resources (2D/3D/array views). Textures are
    usually large, streamed per-mip, and have different eviction/streaming
    behavior than material constants.

- **Range 4: Samplers** (New)
  - **Register**: `s0`, space0
  - **Heap Indices**: Dedicated to sampler states.
  - **Usage**: Stores sampler configurations for texture sampling, such as
    filtering and addressing modes.
  - **Example**: A sampler in this range might define trilinear filtering and
    wrap addressing for a diffuse texture, ensuring smooth texture mapping on 3D
    models.

### Summary Table for Common Resource Placements

| Resource Type       | Logical Range | Register / Slot        | Notes / Indexing                         |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Vertex Buffers      | Range 1       | SRV (t0, space0)       | Stable per-VB index; accessed by vertex shader |
| Index Buffers       | Range 1       | SRV (t0, space0)       | Stable per-IB index; used with VB pairs  |
| Material Constants  | Range 2       | SRV (t0, space0)       | Structured buffer lives in unified SRV table at materials domain base |
| Transforms          | Range 1       | SRV (t0, space0)       | Per-object buffers or SoA arrays indexed by object ID |
| Textures            | Range 3       | SRV (t0, space0)       | Texture SRVs live in unified SRV table at textures domain base |
| Samplers            | Range 4       | Sampler (s0)           | Unique sampler indices; stable states    |

### Real-World Scenario: Rendering a Character

Consider a scenario where a character model is rendered in a game:

1. **Constant Buffers (Range 0)**:
   - The `SceneConstants` buffer provides the view and projection matrices,
     ensuring the character is rendered in the correct position relative to the
     camera.

2. **Structured Buffers (Range 1)**:
   - The vertex buffer contains the character's mesh data, including positions,
     normals, and texture coordinates.
   - The index buffer defines how the vertices are connected to form triangles.
   - A transform buffer stores the character's world matrix, which is used to
     position and animate the character in the scene.

3. **Material Constants (Range 2)**:
   - Material constants for the character's skin and clothing are stored in a
     large structured buffer in Range 2.
   - The pixel shader fetches these constants dynamically using a material
     index, applying properties like base color, roughness, and metalness.

4. **Textures (Range 3)**:
   - Diffuse, normal, and specular maps live in the unified SRV table (`t0`,
     space0) within the textures domain (base + slot).
   - These textures are sampled in the pixel shader to apply detailed surface
     properties to the character.

5. **Samplers (Range 4)**:
   - A sampler with anisotropic filtering ensures high-quality texture sampling,
     even at oblique viewing angles.

By organizing resources into these logical ranges, the engine ensures efficient
access and management, enabling high-performance rendering for complex scenes in
a bindless-first architecture.

### 4.2 Shader Integration

Shaders access these resources using the bindless model, referencing them by
their indices within the unified heap. Below is an example of a vertex and pixel
shader that integrates with the unified descriptor heap, following the
conventions used in the engine:

- Vertex Shader:

  ```hlsl
  // Vertex shader example
  struct VSOutput {
      float4 position : SV_POSITION;
      float3 color : COLOR;
  };

  [shader("vertex")]
  VSOutput VS(uint vertexID : SV_VertexID) {
      VSOutput output;

      // Access per-draw metadata buffer through dynamic slot
      StructuredBuffer<DrawMetadata> draw_meta_buffer = ResourceDescriptorHeap[bindless_indices_slot];
      DrawMetadata meta = draw_meta_buffer[g_DrawIndex];

      // Access vertex buffer
      StructuredBuffer<Vertex> vertex_buffer = ResourceDescriptorHeap[meta.vertex_buffer_index];
      Vertex vertex = vertex_buffer[vertexID];

      // Apply world, view, and projection transforms
      float4 world_pos = mul(world_matrix, float4(vertex.position, 1.0));
      float4 view_pos = mul(view_matrix, world_pos);
      float4 proj_pos = mul(projection_matrix, view_pos);

      output.position = proj_pos;
      output.color = vertex.color.rgb;
      return output;
  }
  ```

- Pixel Shader:

  ```hlsl
  // Pixel shader example
  [shader("pixel")]
  float4 PS(VSOutput input) : SV_Target0 {
      // Default: just vertex color if materials buffer is not available
      float4 result = float4(input.color, 1.0);

      // Access per-draw metadata to find the material index for this draw
      StructuredBuffer<DrawMetadata> draw_meta_buffer = ResourceDescriptorHeap[bindless_indices_slot];
      DrawMetadata meta = draw_meta_buffer[g_DrawIndex];

      // Read material constants for this draw
      StructuredBuffer<MaterialConstants> materials = ResourceDescriptorHeap[bindless_material_constants_slot];
      MaterialConstants mat = materials[meta.material_index];

      // Simple unlit shading: vertex color modulated by material base color
      float3 base_rgb = mat.base_color.rgb;
      float  base_a   = mat.base_color.a;
      result = float4(input.color * base_rgb, base_a);

      return result;
  }
  ```

These shaders demonstrate how to fetch vertex data, apply transforms, and use
material constants for shading. They align with the conventions and structures
defined in the engine, ensuring compatibility with the unified descriptor heap.

#### Shader slot mapping (quick reference)

Below are the symbolic shader-slot names used in examples and a suggested
register mapping. Update your shader headers and renderer constants to match
these names for clarity:

- `bindless_indices_slot`          -> `b1` (Range 0, Scene constants / indices
  table)  # Implementation note: the current codebase uses `b1` (see
  `src/Oxygen/Renderer/Renderer.cpp`) and shaders (e.g.
  `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Shaders/FullScreenTriangle.hlsl`). Update both
  code and shaders via a single source-of-truth header to avoid drift.
- `bindless_geometry_slot`         -> `t0` (Range 1, VB/IB/Transforms; unified
  SRV table)
- `bindless_materials_slot`        -> `t0` (Range 2, Materials domain within
  unified SRV table)
- `bindless_textures_slot`         -> `t0` (Range 3, Textures domain within
  unified SRV table)
- `bindless_samplers_slot`         -> `s0` (Range 4, Samplers)

When updating shaders, prefer symbolic slot names (above) and keep a single
source-of-truth mapping in your renderer so changes are applied consistently.

> You can represent domains in two equivalent ways while preserving the

### 4.3 Implementation status & TODO (render passes / root signatures)

The repository contains partial infrastructure for bindless root signatures and
pipeline descriptions, but several pieces remain unimplemented or inconsistent
with the logical ranges described above. The list below marks the current status
and actionable changes required to fully implement Section 4. Items are ordered
for a practical implementation sequence; stretch/automation items are last.

- [ ] Descriptor-table binding in render passes
  - Status: Missing. `RenderPass::Execute` sets pipeline state but does not bind
    the unified descriptor heap / descriptor tables. `BindIndicesBuffer` is
    currently a no-op and there is no explicit call to set descriptor
    tables/heaps on the command recorder.
  - Action: Bind descriptor heaps and descriptor tables in `RenderPass::Execute`
    (short-term). Use the command recorder to call SetDescriptorHeaps and
    SetRootDescriptorTable for the single unified SRV/CBV/UAV table (`t0`,
    space0) and the SAMPLER table (`s0`) before draws. Optimize later to
    bind-on-change in `PrepareResources`.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/CommandRecorder.*`.

- [ ] Populate root signature / pipeline description with bindless ranges
  - Status: Partial / placeholder. Per-pass `CreatePipelineStateDesc()`
    implementations (e.g., `ShaderPass::CreatePipelineStateDesc`,
    `DepthPrePass::CreatePipelineStateDesc`) must emit root-binding entries
    describing a single unified SRV descriptor table (t0, space0), a sampler
    table (s0), and any direct CBVs/push constants used by the pass.
  - Action: Ensure every `GraphicsPipelineDesc` created by passes includes a
    `RootBindings` layout that contains DescriptorTableBinding entries for:
    - unified bindless SRV table (Range 1..3 domains under `t0`, space0)
    - samplers table (Range 4, `s0`) Also include a direct CBV entry for
    `SceneConstants` (`b1`) and a push-constant/root-constant entry for the draw
    index.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/ShaderPass.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Renderer/DepthPrePass.cpp`, `src/Oxygen/Renderer/*Pass.cpp`.

- [ ] Sampler table handling
  - Status: Not wired. The doc proposes samplers in a dedicated range; the pass
    root bindings/comments reference `s0` but code does not explicitly bind a
    sampler table.
  - Action: Implement a sampler descriptor table (Range 4, `s0`), populate
    sampler descriptors at init, add a sampler-table root parameter to pipeline
    descriptions, and bind it in `RenderPass::Execute`.
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Renderer/ShaderPass.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Renderer/DepthPrePass.cpp`,
    `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.cpp`.

- [ ] DescriptorAllocator API additions (per-range base indices) and validation
  - Status: Likely partial. Separate logical ranges for geometry/materials/
    textures require explicit base indices and capacity accounting.
  - Action: Add APIs:
    - `GetDomainBaseIndex(ResourceViewType, DescriptorVisibility)` â†’ base index
    - `Reserve(ResourceViewType, DescriptorVisibility, uint32_t count)` â†’ base
      index or failure
    - Ensure `GetRemainingDescriptorsCount(view_type, visibility)` is public and
      reliable for budgeting
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/DescriptorAllocator.h`,
    `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Direct3D12/Bindless/DescriptorAllocator.cpp`.

- [ ] ResourceRegistry slot/generation APIs
  - Status: Missing. Needed to guarantee stable bindless indices with
    generation-based aliasing protection and hot-reload semantics.
  - Action: Add APIs:
    - `AllocateView/AllocateSlot(...)` â†’ returns shader-visible slot index and
      generation
    - `ReleaseSlot(handle)` â†’ marks for deferred reuse and returns pending fence
    - `GetSlotMetadata(handle)` â†’ { index, generation, resource_key,
      pending_fence, size_bytes }
    - `UpdateViewInPlace` / `ReplaceView` to keep descriptor slot stable on
      hot-reload
  - Files: `src/Oxygen/Graphics/Common/ResourceRegistry.h`.

- [ ] CPU-only generation validation for handles
  - Status: Missing in headers and validation.
  - Action: Keep `BindlessHandle` as a strongly-typed 32-bit shader-visible
    index with no bit packing. Do not emit index/generation bit masks to
  shaders. Add debug-only validation comparing CPU-side handle.generation vs
  slot.generation on submit. Use a single invalid sentinel:
  `NEXUS_HANDLE_INVALID = oxygen::engine::kInvalidBindlessIndex =
  std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()`.
  - Files: generated BindingSlots headers (sentinels only), `ResourceRegistry`,
    renderer code.

- [ ] Runtime validation and CI tests for root-signature vs doc
  - Status: Not implemented. There is no automatic validation ensuring shaders
    and `GraphicsPipelineDesc` agree with the Nexus binding model.
  - Action: Add a startup validation that compares pipeline root-binding layout
    against the documented mapping (fail fast in debug/CI). Add a small unit
    test that verifies the per-pass `GraphicsPipelineDesc.RootBindings()`
    contains expected descriptor table entries.
  - Files: tests under `Testing/` or `src/Oxygen/Renderer/tests`, plus
    `src/Oxygen/Renderer/RenderPass.*` for runtime checks.

- [ ] Tests & CI hooks
  - Status: Missing.
  - Action: Add unit tests for:
    - Allocate/Release and generation increment (DescriptorAllocator /
      ResourceRegistry)
    - Reserve contiguous indices for multi-slot geometry
    - Shader-visible index bounds validation (startup check) Add a CI startup
    check (debug-only) verifying that `GraphicsPipelineDesc.RootBindings()`
    agrees with the produced `BindingSlots` header.
  - Files: tests under `Testing/` and/or `src/Oxygen/Renderer/tests`.

- [ ] Backend capability gating (Phase 1: D3D12-first)
  - Status: Required for portability.
  - Action: Target D3D12 direct-indexing behavior
    (`D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_CBV_SRV_UAV_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED`) and the
    D3D12 descriptor heap model. Add per-backend capability checks; treat Vulkan
    as Phase 2.
  - Files: platform backends and initialization paths.

### 4.4 Validation and Debugging

To ensure correctness, the following validation steps are performed:

1. **Descriptor Range Validation**:
   - Ensure that all resources fit within their designated ranges.
   - Validate that heap indices are stable and do not overlap. The
     `D3D12HeapAllocationStrategy` enforces nonâ€‘overlapping ranges and throws on
     invalid JSON or overlaps at startup.

2. **Shader Compatibility Checks**:
   - Verify that shaders reference the correct registers and spaces.
   - Ensure that the root signature matches the expected layout.

3. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Provide overlays to visualize resource bindings and heap usage.
   - Log detailed information about descriptor allocations and bindings.

This logical structuring ensures that the unified descriptor heap can
efficiently manage all required resources while maintaining compatibility with
the bindless rendering model.

## 5. Caching, Residency, and Upload in D3D12

This section specifies how Nexus caches resources, keeps them resident on the
GPU, assigns stable bindless indices, and moves bytes efficiently using Direct3D
12. It consolidates the data model, memory/heap strategy,
upload/synchronization, budgeting/eviction, and validation into a single,
actionable contract.

### 5.1 Goals and Contract

What Nexus guarantees to the rest of the engine:

- Stable bindless indices for the lifetime of each resource instance (Section 4
  defines descriptor ABI). Indices only change when a resource is truly
  destroyed and its slot is recycled after a fence.
- Deterministic upload and residency: transforms â†’ materials â†’ geometry â†’
  textures. Each domain has a clear memory backing and admission policy.
- D3D12â€‘correct resource states and synchronization: resources are transitioned
  for copy and consumption; crossâ€‘queue work is serialized by fences.
- Graceful failure: when budgets are exceeded or uploads are not yet complete,
  Nexus returns fallback handles that remain valid and shaderâ€‘safe.

Success criteria:

- No descriptor aliasing or outâ€‘ofâ€‘bounds access in debug builds; validation
  asserts early.
- No CPU stalls on the graphics queue for uploads; staging uses upload heaps and
  copy operations with proper fencing.
- Stable frame time: uploads and evictions amortized; no large heap
  reâ€‘creations, no descriptor heap thrash.

Error modes and handling:

- Outâ€‘ofâ€‘budget: return fallback handles, schedule retry, emit structured logs
  with domain and bytes requested.
- Late data: keep previous contents or fallback bound; never publish a
  halfâ€‘resident descriptor to shaders.
- Stale handles: generation mismatch detected in debug; draw is skipped or
  downgraded with a default.

### 5.2 Data Model and Handles

Domains: Transforms, Materials, Geometry, Textures. Each domain has an
allocation policy, budget, and descriptor range (see Section 4 for binding
slots).

- Handle shape (CPU): a versioned handle carries both the shaderâ€‘visible index
  and a CPUâ€‘only generation counter. Default invalid is
  `oxygen::engine::kInvalidBindlessIndex`.
  - Index: full 32â€‘bit, stronglyâ€‘typed BindlessHandle used directly by shaders.
  - Generation: maintained only on the CPU (not encoded in the 32â€‘bit index),
    used for validation and safe reuse.
  - Shaders only see the 32â€‘bit index; there are no bit masks or packing in
    shader code.

CPUâ€‘side types (sketch):

```cpp
using BindlessIndex  = oxy::NamedType<uint32_t, struct _BindlessIndexTag>;
using Generation     = oxy::NamedType<uint32_t, struct _GenerationTag>;

struct VersionedBindlessHandle {
  BindlessIndex index;     // shaderâ€‘visible 32â€‘bit index
  Generation    generation; // CPUâ€‘only generation counter

  VersionedBindlessHandle() noexcept
    : index(BindlessIndex{0u}), generation(Generation{0u}) {}
  VersionedBindlessHandle(BindlessIndex idx, Generation gen) noexcept
    : index(idx), generation(gen) {}

  // Optional CPUâ€‘side packing for maps/keys; shaders never see this
  static VersionedBindlessHandle FromPacked(uint64_t p) noexcept {
    return { BindlessIndex{static_cast<uint32_t>(p & 0xFFFFFFFFu)},
             Generation{static_cast<uint32_t>(p >> 32)} };
  }
  uint64_t ToPacked() const noexcept {
    return (static_cast<uint64_t>(static_cast<uint32_t>(generation)) << 32) |
            static_cast<uint32_t>(index);
  }
  BindlessHandle ToBindlessHandle() const noexcept {
    return BindlessHandle{static_cast<uint32_t>(index)};
  }
};
```

- Slot metadata (per allocation): { handle, state, shader_index, generation,
  last_used_frame, size_bytes, resident_mip_mask (textures), pending_fence,
  resource_key }.
- Descriptor index: computed once by the DescriptorAllocator as shader_index =
  domain_base + slot_index; shaders must not add base again.

States: Invalid â†’ Staged â†’ Resident â†’ PendingEvict â†’ Evicted â†’ Free. Transitions
are driven by uploads, fences, and budgeting.

### 5.3 Memory and Heaps (D3D12)

Resource heaps and placements:

- Upload staging: D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD buffers, persistently mapped (Map once,
  never Unmap). Ring allocators per queue with at least N frames of headroom.
  Align to D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT (for textures) and natural
  alignment for buffers.
- GPU resident: D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT committed resources or placed
  suballocations in larger arenas (preferred for geometry). Transforms and small
  materials are typically packed in large structured buffers; geometry lives in
  vertex/index arenas; textures use default heap resources (wholeâ€‘resource
  streaming in Phase A; perâ€‘mip/tiled in Phase B).
- Readback (optional): D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_READBACK for diagnostics and tools.

Descriptor heaps and root binding:

- One shaderâ€‘visible CBV/SRV/UAV heap for all SRV/UAV/CBV (up to 1M
  descriptors).
- One shaderâ€‘visible SAMPLER heap (up to 2048 samplers).
- Root signature uses
  D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_CBV_SRV_UAV_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED and
  D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_SAMPLER_HEAP_DIRECTLY_INDEXED. Passes index into
  ResourceDescriptorHeap[] and SamplerDescriptorHeap[] from shaders.
- Keep shaderâ€‘visible heaps persistent for the life of the device. Use a
  CPUâ€‘only staging heap for descriptor edits and
  CopyDescriptors(â€¦)/CopyDescriptorsSimple(â€¦) into the GPU heap to avoid
  fragmentation and churn.

Resource states and transitions (typical):

- Upload: Transition(default) â†’ COPY_DEST, perform
  CopyBufferRegion/CopyTextureRegion, Transition to target read state:
  - CBV buffers: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VERTEX_AND_CONSTANT_BUFFER.
  - SRV buffers: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE |
    D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE.
  - VB/IB: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_VERTEX_AND_CONSTANT_BUFFER /
    D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDEX_BUFFER.
  - Textures (SRV): NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE | PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE.

Queues and synchronization:

- Prefer a dedicated copy queue for staging heavy uploads. Signal a fence on the
  copy queue; make the graphics queue Wait on that fence before the first use of
  the resource. If using a single direct queue in Phase A, the same fence still
  gates slot visibility.
- Nâ€‘framesâ€‘inâ€‘flight fences protect ring reuse and slot recycling. A slot is not
  recycled until its pending_fence â‰¤ completed value.

### 5.4 Upload Pipeline and Synchronization

Deterministic flow per frame (Phase A): ScenePrep â†’ Allocate (slot) â†’ Stage
(upload heap ring) â†’ Record copy (copy or direct queue) â†’ Transition to read
state â†’ Publish descriptor â†’ Mark Resident when fence passes.

Practical notes:

- Footprints: Use GetCopyableFootprints for texture uploads to compute
  subresource footprints and row pitches. Respect
  D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PITCH_ALIGNMENT.
- Batching: Coalesce multiple small uploads per domain to minimize Copy/Barrier
  count. Group by destination heap and target state.
- Persistent mapping: Each ring has a CPU pointer; writes are memcpy only. Track
  write head with alignment padding; wraparound requires fenceâ€‘based wait.
- Bindless publication: The descriptorâ€™s GPU slot is written only when backing
  memory is fully uploaded and transitioned. Before that, a fallback descriptor
  lives at the slot, guaranteeing shader safety.
- On failure (budget/full ring): allocate a default/fallback handle and keep the
  request queued for retry in subsequent frames.

Phase B evolution (parallel): move staging to perâ€‘domain SPSC rings and uploader
threads; record copies on the copy queue; graphics queue waits on a perâ€‘batch
fence. The external contract remains unchanged.

### 5.5 Budgets, Residency, and Eviction

Budgets:

- Perâ€‘domain byte budgets are tracked against allocations in default heaps. Use
  IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo to observe local memory usage/available
  budget and, optionally, SetVideoMemoryReservation to cap usage.
- Admission control via ReserveBudget(domain, bytes): succeeds and commits or
  fails and returns a fallback handle. Budgets are soft in development, hard in
  CI.

Residency and reuse:

- A slot becomes Resident once its upload fence has completed and the descriptor
  points at the final view. Slots freed midâ€‘frame enter PendingEvict and are
  recycled only after their fence completes. Generation is incremented on
  recycle.

Eviction policy:

- Triggered by budget pressure, OS/driver notifications, or policy
  (age/priority). Primary heuristic is LRU with optional priority boosts.
  Textures prefer wholeâ€‘resource eviction in Phase A; perâ€‘mip eviction is
  introduced with tiled resources in Phase B (maintain a minimum mip floor to
  avoid shimmering).
- Eviction sequence: select candidate â†’ mark PendingEvict â†’ ensure not inâ€‘flight
  (fence) â†’ replace descriptor with fallback â†’ free GPU bytes â†’ increment
  generation â†’ return slot to free list.

### 5.6 Bindless Indices and Validation

Index assignment:

- Each domain has a base index and capacity inside the unified descriptor heap.
  Final shader index is shader_index = base + slot_index. These values are
  emitted to C++ and HLSL from a single source (BindingSlots).

Validation (debugâ€‘only):

- Bounds: assert that shader_index falls within the domainâ€™s [base,
  base+capacity) before publishing.
- Generation check: when a handle is used for a draw, compare handle.generation
  against slot.generation in a CPU shadow map; mismatch triggers a warning and
  forces a default.
- Root signature/heap checks at startup: verify descriptor heap sizes and root
  parameter layout match Section 4; fail fast if not. Heap sizes/capacities are
  sourced from the generated JSON (Section 3.7); parse/validation failures throw
  exceptions for graceful shutdown.

Invalid/sentinel handling:

- Only `oxygen::engine::kInvalidBindlessIndex`
  (=`std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()`) is reserved as invalid. Index `0` is
  valid. Shaders branch to default resources on the invalid sentinel.

### 5.7 API Surface (sketch)

Nexus exposes minimal, explicit calls; implementations may be backendâ€‘specific
behind the same interface.

```cpp
class NexusRegistry {
public:
  // Admission and allocation
  bool ReserveBudget(Domain domain, size_t bytes);
  BindlessHandle Allocate(ResourceKey key, Domain domain, size_t sizeBytes, UploadIntent intent);
  void UpdateViewInPlace(BindlessHandle h, const ViewDesc& view); // keep index stable on hotâ€‘reload
  void Release(BindlessHandle h); // deferred reuse; increments generation on recycle

  // Queries
  std::optional<BindlessHandle> FindResident(ResourceKey key) const;
  ResidencyState QueryResidency(BindlessHandle h) const; // textures: QueryResidencyMip(h, mip) in Phase B

  // Frame orchestration
  void ProcessUploadsAndSubmit(CommandRecorder& copy, CommandRecorder& gfx);
  void TickEviction(uint64_t frameIndex);
};
```

### 5.8 Testing and Observability

- Unit tests: allocation/reuse/generation; contiguous allocation for multiâ€‘slot
  geometry; bounds/handle validation; fallback on budget failure.
- Integration tests: deterministic upload order; eviction under pressure;
  descriptor heap layout matches BindingSlots.
- Runtime tools: residency heatmaps, eviction and thrash logs, allocation
  traces; optional ValidateHandlesOnUse in debug. Name all D3D12 objects and
  emit PIX markers around upload/transition blocks; enable DRED for postâ€‘mortem
  analysis.

Notes on scope

- Section 4 defines the descriptor ABI and symbolic slot mapping used here.
  Section 6 details Phase A/Phase B pipelines and threading; this section
  defines the invariant contract that those pipelines must uphold.

## 6. Upload System

### Phase 1: Basic Upload Pipeline

- Single-threaded staging and submission
  One staging ring per queue; coalesce via `StageBufferUploads`, group by
  destination to minimize copy calls.
- Deterministic upload order (e.g. transforms â†’ materials â†’ geometry â†’ textures)
  ScenePrep calls domain uploaders in fixed order; results are cached in
  per-frame state.
- Explicit synchronization points between subsystems
  Per-domain fences; N=3 frames in flight by default. CPU never recycles a
  suballoc until signaled.
- Integration with ScenePrep finalization (sequential orchestration)
  Uploaders: TransformUploader, MaterialUploader, GeometryUploader,
  TextureUploader. Assemblers consume handles and build the final draw lists.
- Logging and validation hooks for resource readiness
  On failure, bind default handles and queue retry; emit structured logs with
  resource keys and budgets.

### Phase 2: Parallel Upload Evolution

- Multi-threaded staging across resource domains
  Per-domain job queues; lock-free SPSC rings for producer â†’ Nexus staging.
- Dependency graph for upload ordering and conflict resolution
  DAG ties materials â†’ textures, geometry â†’ buffers; scheduler respects edges
  while maximizing parallelism.
- Thread-safe residency map updates and dirty region tracking
  Sharded maps per category with epoch-based reclamation; range merges performed
  on worker threads.
- GPU submission batching with minimal stalls
  Batch copy/compute submissions by resource and state; compact barriers.
- Integration with render graph or submission queue abstraction
  Optional backend plug that records uploads into a render graph stage or a
  submission queue object.
- Debugging tools for upload race detection and profiling
  Timeline events for staging/submit/fence; race-detection mode asserts if two
  writers touch the same range in a frame.

## 7. Eviction Strategy

- Residency tracking and scoring heuristics
  LRU with score boosts for proximity/importance; textures honor a minimum
  resident mip floor.
- Dirty flag propagation and eviction triggers
  Evict only clean ranges; dirty uploads keep items pinned until committed.
- Streaming policies and asset lifetime management
  On-demand, ahead-of-time, and pinned policies; per-asset residency budgets.
- Open questions: eviction granularity, predictive models
  Geometry eviction at submesh vs whole-mesh; per-mip eviction vs atlas; explore
  ML/heuristic predictors under pressure.

## 8. ScenePrep Finalization

- Finalization boundaries and orchestration scope
  Filter â†’ Uploaders â†’ Sort/Partition â†’ Assemblers â†’ Outputs (RenderItemsList,
  DrawMetadata, partitions).
- Resource readiness and upload completion guarantees
  Assemblers read only from per-frame caches validated by Nexus fences; defaults
  applied on miss.
- Integration with render graph or submission pipeline
  Finalization can emit resource barriers and late uploads into a graph/queue
  stage.
- Testability and validation hooks
  CPU-only mode bypasses GPU work; deterministic outputs validated by unit tests
  and property tests.

## 9. Tooling and Workflow Integration

- VSCode/IntelliSense hygiene in multi-target workspaces
  Use per-config compile_commands and conditional includes; keep headers
  shader-friendly.
- Automated analysis for naming and layout correctness
  CI checks naming rules and struct/shader layout hashes.
- Debug overlays and GPU buffer inspection
  Optional overlays visualize bindless indices, residency heatmaps, and eviction
  events.
- Wishlist: context-aware code navigation
  Jump-to-definition between shader defines and C++ structs; hover showing
  layout/hash.

## 10. Testing and Simulation Modes

- CPU-only mode for deterministic validation
  Heap-backed buffers/images; integer handles; no GPU calls.
- GPU-backed mode for performance profiling
  D3D12/Vulkan backends with identical contracts; timings exposed for profiling.
- Unit test scaffolding and mock resource injection
  Scenario-based tests for each uploader/assembler; mocks for residency and
  bindless tables.
- Notes on reproducibility and test coverage
  Fixed seeds for generators; stable sort keys; property tests for idempotent
  batches.

## 11. Extensibility and Future Considerations

- Leverage the modularity of the `RenderPass` base class to introduce additional
  root constants or descriptor tables for new rendering techniques.
- Explore GPU-driven pipelines or advanced culling methods that can benefit from
  the existing bindless-first design.
