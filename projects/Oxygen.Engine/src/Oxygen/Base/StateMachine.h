//! Represents a Finite State Machine (FSM).
/*!
 The FSM has a set of possible states and a set of rules that govern transitions
 between the current state and some other state upon receiving an event.

 A state can be an arbitrary object, which type is used to distinguish it from
 other states. Therefore, there is no need to maintain a list of known states
 (in an enumeration for example). We also don't want to enforce any relationship
 between those types to keep them completely independent. The state machine is a
 variadic template that gets to know its states through the parameter pack and
 stores them in a tuple.

 The state machine keeps track of the current state as a `std::variant` (which
 can accommodate the diversity of state types) and assumes that the first state
 provided to it is the *initial state*. It is possible however to explicitly
 transition the state machine into a specific state using its `TransitionTo()`
 method.

 Transitions from the current state to other states are triggered by events.
 This requires that all the state types have a `Handle` method that accepts an
 event of the type of event being handled. To avoid creating unnecessary
 dependencies between the state types and the state machine type, a state's
 `Handle` method will return an object of a specific type (an action) that will
 describe what action should the machine take.

 @snippet StateMachine_doc_test.cpp State Handle method

 In principle, a state machine should always transition to some state after
 receiving an event, even if itâ€™s the same state as the current one. When we
 want to skip performing a transition action, we can simply use the helper
 action type 'DoNothing'.

 Events are produced outside the state machine and fed into it by an external
 event loop which calls the state machine's `Handle()` method. The latter
 dispatches the event to the current state, which returns a specific action that
 gets executed to eventually transition to a new state. Event handlers, the
 action execution, and anything inside could throw exceptions to report errors
 that are *all* caught and translated into an execution status returned to the
 event production loop.

 The execution status can take one of the following types documented in the
 class: Continue, Terminate, TerminateWithError and ReissueEvent. Refer to the
 documentation of these types and the StateMachine::Status.

   machine that can be to continue processing more events, terminate with no
   error or terminate with error.

   A special case is when an event results in a state transition but the new
   state prefers to handle the event in one of its handlers rather than in the
   `OnEnter` method. That particular situation corresponds to the execution
   status `ReissueEvent` which requires the event production loop to reissue

//! An action type that represents a state transition from the current state to
//! the target state specified as a template parameter.
/*!
 This action supports rich states which may contain data and may have some
 complex logic that utilizes that data to decide on the next state transition.
 When being executed by the state machine, it is provided with the current state
 (through the state machine instance), the newly selected state and the event
 that triggered the transition.

 Furthermore, it calls the OnLeave method on the previous state and OnEnter on
 the destination state, provided they are in the states interface. (Uses SFINAE
 to detect if such a method exists; see
 https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae)

 The requirement on the OnLeave method is to return a State object that can only
 be one of Continue, Terminate or TerminateWithError. The OnEnter method on the
 other hand can return any of the possible values of Status.

 ### Example

 @snippet StateMachine_test.cpp TransitionTo example

 A state can implement a Handle method that returns a TransitionTo object
 constructed with a piece of data (std::any object) that will be passed to the
 next state when its onEnter method is called. The next state can opt to ignore
 that data by implementing onEnter(Event evt) only or can opt to use the data
 by implementing onEnter(Event evt, std::any data).
