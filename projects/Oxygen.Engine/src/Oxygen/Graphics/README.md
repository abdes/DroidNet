### üîÑ Maestro (The Coordinator)

#### Core Responsibilities

- **Work Synchronization:**
    - **Fence Management**
      In Direct3D 12, create an **ID3D12Fence** for each command queue, then
      signal or wait on specific fence values to coordinate when tasks begin or
      end. The Coordinator tracks these fence values to ensure that each
      subsystem‚Äôs work completes in the correct order and avoids unintended
      overlaps.

    - **Timeline Semaphores**
      While D3D12 doesn‚Äôt provide native timeline semaphores (as Vulkan does),
      the Coordinator can mimic timeline behavior by incrementing fence values
      each submission and waiting on specific thresholds. This keeps multi-queue
      workloads in sync without explicitly tying into resource operations.

- **Execution Timeline Coordination:**
    - **Global Timeline**
      Maintain a global counter to represent the last completed segment of work.
      Each time the Coordinator processes submitted tasks, it updates the fence
      value and checks if any tasks depend on previous completions.
    - **Dependency Graph**
      If a subsystem needs other work to finish first, the Coordinator inserts
      waits on the relevant fence value. This ensures the correct sequence of
      steps‚Äîfor instance, finishing a compute pass before a rendering pass that
      consumes its results.

- **Periodic Events Management:**
    - **RenderFrameBegin**
      The Coordinator triggers this event at the start of each frame, notifying
      subsystems that it‚Äôs safe to queue up draw commands, refresh dynamic data,
      or perform any pre-render setup.
    - **RenderFrameEnd**
      Once all rendering for the frame is submitted, the Coordinator signals the
      *end* event. Higher-level logic may use this signal to handle post-frame
      operations, like capturing frame stats or triggering GPU-side analytics.

- **Frame Buffering and Vsync Management:**
    - **Buffer Count Configuration**
      For double or triple buffering, the Coordinator instructs the swap chain
      (via `DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC1::BufferCount`) but doesn‚Äôt allocate or manage
      the buffers itself‚Äîthat remains with the Renderer module.
    - **In-Flight Frames**
      The Coordinator tracks fence values associated with each buffer to ensure
      that the GPU has finished work on a given buffer before reusing it. This
      prevents overwriting a buffer that‚Äôs still in use on the GPU.
    - **Vsync Coordination**
      Vsync is handled by specifying the correct swap chain parameters (e.g.,
      sync interval for `Present`). The Coordinator ensures the present call
      respects the selected intervals and that fences are signaled so the engine
      smoothly proceeds to the next frame without tearing.

## Component Interactions and Data Flow

### Frame Execution Flow (Asynchronous Coroutines)

The rendering pipeline operates as a network of interconnected asynchronous
tasks, with natural suspension points where operations await GPU completion:

1. **Frame Initialization**
   - **Graphics Context** spawns the frame execution coroutine
   - This coroutine establishes frame-level state and dispatches parallel tasks

2. **Event Signaling**
   - **Maestro** asynchronously broadcasts the frame begin event
   - Subsystems subscribe to this event and activate their respective coroutines

3. **Resource Acquisition**
   - **Renderer's** swapchain image acquisition suspends until a buffer is available
   - Upon resumption, it signals downstream coroutines that surface resources are ready

4. **Parallel Command Recording**
   - Multiple subsystem coroutines execute concurrently:
     - **SceneOrganizer** generates scene data asynchronously, yielding when dependencies arise
     - **MaterialManager** updates parameter buffers in parallel with other systems
     - **LightMaster** asynchronously processes light updates and shadow information
     - **Animation** transforms skeletal data without blocking other subsystems

5. **Pipeline Resolution**
   - **PipelineArchitect** awaits shader and state requests, resuming when dependencies resolve
   - Caches responses to avoid redundant pipeline creation

6. **Submission Coordination**
   - **Commander** awaits completion of all recording coroutines
   - Batches commands and submits them without blocking the main thread

7. **Synchronization**
   - **Maestro** places synchronization points between queue submissions
   - Yields execution until critical GPU operations complete

8. **Presentation**
   - **Renderer** presentation coroutine suspends until the optimal present moment
   - Resumes when timing conditions align with VSync requirements

9. **Completion Signaling**
   - **Maestro** signals frame end after presentation completes
   - New frame coroutines can begin while previous frame finalization continues in parallel

### Resource Creation Flow
1. **Graphics Context** receives resource creation request
2. **Resources** creates the resource descriptor
3. **Allocator** provides memory for the resource
4. **Resources** finalizes resource creation
5. **Resources** creates necessary views

### Shader Pipeline Flow
1. **ShaderCompiler** compiles shader code
2. **ShaderLibrary** stores compiled shaders
3. **PipelineArchitect** uses shader bytecode for pipeline creation
4. **Resources** creates descriptor views based on shader reflection data
