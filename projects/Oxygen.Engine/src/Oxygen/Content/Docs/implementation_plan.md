## Current Status Summary

Synchronous loading, caching, and forward-only dependency registration are
implemented (see `AssetLoader.*`, `ResourceTable.h`, `PakFile.*`). Safe
unloading protections (cycle rejection + recursion guard + single-thread policy)
are in place; remaining work is completion of specific ordering diagnostics &
tests (see missing tests list below). Async pipeline, streaming, residency
management, and hot-reload are still pending design ‚Üí implementation transition.

No SceneAsset implementation exists yet; integration with the Scene subsystem
will depend on establishing a `SceneAsset` descriptor + build tooling. Internal
key separation (`InternalResourceKey.h`) is present for encapsulation of
resource indices; future unification/clarification doc is needed.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1 (Foundation) ‚Äì COMPLETE

Scope: Core caching, dependency registration, reference counting, baseline
synchronous loaders, safe unloading protections.

Outcome Summary:

* Forward-only dependency tracking with cycle detection and recursion guard
  implemented.
* Reverse dependency maps removed (simpler, memory-stable design validated under
  soak).
* Single-thread confinement policy enforced (foundation phase) ahead of async
  introduction.
* Verbose eviction diagnostics available (log level gated).
* All core infrastructure & asset loading matrix items (except Hot Reload) at ‚úÖ.

### Phase 2 (Async CPU Pipeline & Renderer Boundary)

Objective: Add asynchronous, non-blocking CPU-side asset acquisition ending at a
"DecodedCPUReady" state (asset + dependencies decoded & cached) without
performing any GPU uploads or assuming GPU residency. Establish a narrow,
explicit boundary for later renderer-driven materialization.

Scope (Content module only):

1. Coroutine task wrappers around current synchronous loaders (file IO +
   decode).
2. ThreadPool integration (`co_threadpool`) for decode / transcode / packing
   work.
3. Non-blocking async file read abstraction (initially still synchronous under
  the hood; interface designed for future true async I/O swap-in).
4. Dual API: `Load(const AssetKey&)` (legacy sync) layered atop `LoadAsync(const
  AssetKey&, CancellationToken)`.
5. Minimal cancellation primitive propagated through loader contexts; cancelled
  operations guarantee no partial cache insertion.
6. Consolidated deduplication: concurrent `LoadAsync` for same key coalesce to a
  single in-flight task (winner populates cache; others await result).
7. Explicit state enum introduced (e.g., `AssetLoadState::{Loading,
  DecodedCPUReady}`) clarifying that GPU residency is external.
8. Definition of a lightweight bridge descriptor (e.g.,
  `GpuMaterializationInfo`) stored with decoded assets but not acted upon by
  Content.

Out of Scope (moved to Renderer or future phases): GPU upload queue, staging
buffer management, residency / LRU, GPU memory budgets, eviction policies.

Deliverables & Acceptance:

* API: `task<AssetHandle> LoadAsync(const AssetKey&, CancellationToken)` returns
  once asset + dependencies reach DecodedCPUReady (no GPU blocking).
* Cancellation test: cancel mid-file read ‚Üí no cache entry, no leaked temp
  buffers.
* Deduplication test: N parallel `LoadAsync` for same key results in exactly one
  decode execution (instrumented counter == 1).
* Dependency await test: dependent asset `LoadAsync` suspends until all direct
  dependencies DecodedCPUReady (not GPU resident).
* Performance sanity: Bulk async load of geometry assets saturates ThreadPool
  with main thread idle except at `co_await` suspend points.
* Documentation: Updated glossary & comments to remove any implication that
  Content ensures GPU residency.
* Bridge descriptor unit test: verifies `GpuMaterializationInfo` populated with
  expected format/usage metadata without invoking renderer code.

### Phase 3 (Hot Reload, Streaming Metadata & Analytics)

Objective: Add dynamic content invalidation, introduce CPU-side streaming /
chunk metadata & prioritization signals (still independent of GPU residency),
and provide analytical tooling for dependency & usage insights.

Scope:

1. Hot Reload: file hash watcher ‚Üí invalidation queue ‚Üí safe unload & reload of
   affected assets; dependency cascade (rebuild dependents to DecodedCPUReady).
2. Chunk / Streaming Metadata: define per-asset chunk descriptors & partial load
   table (e.g., mesh LOD segments, texture mip groups) stored in Content cache.
3. Priority & Prefetch Hints: lightweight API (`SetAssetPriority`,
   `PrefetchAsync`) that schedules background decode ahead of expected use (no
   GPU action).
4. Progressive/Partial Decode Hooks: optional staged decode phases (e.g., header
   parse first ‚Üí schedule heavy body decode) enabling fast placeholder data.
5. Dependency Analyzer Tool: export graph (JSON + Graphviz) with reference
   counts, shared dependency fan-out statistics.
6. Observability: instrumentation counters (decode time, IO time, queue wait)
   exposed via a Content diagnostics API.

Out of Scope: Actual GPU memory budgets, GPU eviction, LRU of GPU resources
(renderer phase).

Deliverables & Acceptance:

* Hot reload test: modify underlying file ‚Üí asset & dependents reach new hash
  version; old handles safely replaced.
* Prefetch test: calling `PrefetchAsync` on N assets triggers background decode
  without blocking main thread.
* Partial decode test: staged loader produces minimal placeholder then completes
  full decode later (verified via timing / state).
* Analyzer CLI produces JSON with nodes = assets, edges = dependencies;
  validated by a unit/integration test snapshot.
* Instrumentation: metrics accessible & unit tested for monotonicity / reset
  behavior.

### Phase 4 (Quality, Benchmarking & Automation)

Objective: Harden the Content subsystem with comprehensive performance / memory
metrics, diagnostic validation, and automated documentation to reduce drift.

Scope:

1. Performance benchmarks: cold load vs warm cache vs parallel burst; measure IO
   latency, decode time, scheduling overhead.
2. Memory diagnostics: peak decoded bytes, per-asset-type footprint,
   fragmentation or slack (if applicable).
3. Dependency integrity checks: shutdown assertions for no dangling dependencies
   / leaked in-flight tasks.
4. Telemetry & Histograms: expose structured event stream (load start/end,
   decode phases, cancellation) plus percentile histograms.
5. Automated documentation generation: scripts extract feature matrix & status
   from annotated code / registry macros.
6. Reliability tests: fuzz or randomized cancellation / interleaving to detect
   race conditions.

Acceptance:

* Benchmark suite produces stable metrics; CI gate can compare against
  thresholds.
* Telemetry API consumed in a sample tool printing histogram percentiles.
* Integrity test simulates random load/cancel sequences ‚Üí zero leaks &
  consistent ref counts.
* Generated docs match manually maintained sections (diff-free) or report
  discrepancies.
