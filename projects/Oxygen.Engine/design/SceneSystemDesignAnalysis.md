## Architectural Overview

The Scene system is architected for high performance and extensibility using a
resource-table storage model, handle/view access patterns, and component-based
architecture. At its core is a central Scene manager that owns all nodes and
orchestrates updates. Nodes are represented by lightweight handles and
implemented as intrusive hierarchical data structures. The system efficiently
handles transform propagation, flag inheritance, and metadata management while
supporting future extensibility through components and event systems.

---

## Core Components Analysis

### System Overview

The Scene system consists of several key components working together:

- **Scene**: Central manager responsible for node lifecycle, hierarchy
  management, and update orchestration using ResourceTable for efficient
  storage and handle-based access
- **SceneNode / SceneNodeImpl**: Public handle interface and internal
  implementation - SceneNode provides a safe, lightweight view with weak_ptr
  validation while SceneNodeImpl stores actual data via component composition
- **ResourceTable**: Dense/sparse storage system enabling fast handle-based
  access and memory efficiency
- **Component Architecture**: SceneNodeImpl uses the Composition system
  providing full component attachment capabilities: ObjectMetaData
  (names/properties), NodeData (scene flags), GraphData (hierarchy
  relationships), TransformComponent (TRS data), plus runtime component
  attachment via `AddComponent<T>()`, `GetComponent<T>()`, `HasComponent<T>()`,
  `RemoveComponent<T>()`
- **Flag System**: Hierarchical 5-bit flags supporting 6 flag types with
  inheritance, dirty tracking, and deferred processing
- **SceneTraversal**: High-performance, non-recursive traversal supporting
  depth-first and breadth-first algorithms with visitor/filter patterns
- **SceneQuery**: High-level, const-correct query interface supporting
  predicate-based and path-based queries with batch execution
- **ScenePrettyPrinter**: Template-based utility for scene graph visualization
  with multiple output formats and configurable rendering options
- **Update System**: Two-pass update cycle (ProcessDirtyFlags + UpdateTransforms)
  with dirty tracking for optimal performance

### Core Component Details

#### TransformComponent - The TRS System

**Mathematical Foundation:**

- **TRS Decomposition**: Separate Translation, Rotation (quaternion), and Scale components
- **Matrix Composition**: `World = Parent_World * Local_TRS`
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Matrices computed only when needed
- **SIMD Optimization**: 16-byte aligned GLM types for vectorized operations

**Performance Implementation:**

```cpp
class TransformComponent {
    alignas(16) Vec3 local_position_{0.0f};     // 16-byte aligned
    alignas(16) Quat local_rotation_{1.0f};     // Quaternion storage
    alignas(16) Vec3 local_scale_{1.0f};        // Uniform/non-uniform scale
    mutable Mat4 world_matrix_{1.0f};           // Cached world transform
    mutable bool is_dirty_ = true;              // Dirty tracking
};
```

#### CameraComponent ‚Äì The Camera System

**Overview:**

The CameraComponent subsystem provides robust support for both perspective and
orthographic camera models as attachable components within the scene graph.
These components enable nodes to serve as camera viewpoints, supporting a wide
range of rendering and simulation scenarios.

- **PerspectiveCamera**: Models real-world camera optics with field of view,
  aspect ratio, and near/far planes. Suitable for 3D scenes requiring depth
  perception.
- **OrthographicCamera**: Projects geometry without perspective distortion,
  using configurable extents. Ideal for 2D, UI, CAD, and isometric views.

**Key Features:**

- **Projection Types**: Both perspective and orthographic projections are
  supported as first-class components.
- **Viewport Support**: Cameras can render to subregions of the output via
  viewport configuration (`SetViewport`, `ResetViewport`, `GetViewport`).
- **Transform Integration**: Cameras require a `TransformComponent` and use the
  node's transform for view matrix computation.
- **Runtime Attachment**: Cameras can be attached, detached, or replaced at
  runtime on any `SceneNode` using type-safe APIs.
- **Type-Safe Access**: `SceneNode::GetCameraAs<T>()` enables safe retrieval of
  the attached camera as a specific type, returning `std::optional` for robust
  error handling.
- **Projection Matrix & Utilities**: Each camera provides methods for computing
  projection matrices and converting between screen and world coordinates.

**Performance/Architecture Notes:**

- Camera components are fully integrated into the component system, supporting
  dependency validation and thread safety.
- The design allows for future extension with additional camera types or custom
  projection models.
- Viewport and projection parameters are decoupled from node transforms,
  ensuring flexibility and correctness.

**Example Usage:**

```cpp
SceneNode node = scene->CreateNode("CameraNode");
node.AttachCamera(stdmake_unique<PerspectiveCamera>(convention));
if (auto cam = node.GetCameraAs<PerspectiveCamera>()) {
  cam->get().SetFieldOfView(glmradians(60.0f));
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Enables flexible camera management for complex scenes (multiple views, editor
  cameras, etc.)
- Supports both 2D and 3D rendering scenarios
- Ensures type safety and runtime flexibility through the component system

#### SceneFlags - The Property System

**6-Flag Layout with 5-Bit Per-Flag Storage:**

Current flags supported:

- `kVisible`: Node visibility for rendering
- `kStatic`: Transform optimization hint (won't change)
- `kCastsShadows`: Shadow casting capability
- `kReceivesShadows`: Shadow receiving capability
- `kRayCastingSelectable`: Ray-casting selection capability
- `kIgnoreParentTransform`: Use only local transform

**5-Bit Per-Flag Layout:**

```text
Bit 0: Effective Value  - Current resolved state
Bit 1: Inheritance      - Whether value comes from parent
Bit 2: Pending Value    - Staged value for next update
Bit 3: Dirty Flag       - Requires processing in update cycle
Bit 4: Previous Value   - For transition detection
```

**State Management Features:**

- **Ternary Logic**: Explicit True/False, Inherited, Default states
- **Deferred Updates**: Changes staged and applied in batch operations via `ProcessDirtyFlags()`
- **Hierarchical Propagation**: Parent values cascade to children automatically
- **Constraint**: Maximum 12 flags supported (5 bits √ó 12 = 60 bits in 64-bit storage)

## Design Patterns Implementation

The Scene system employs sophisticated design patterns that contribute to its
performance, safety, and maintainability, working together to create a robust
foundation for high-performance 3D scene management.

### Core Patterns

#### 1. Handle/View Pattern

**Implementation Features:**

- **Resource Safety**: Weak references prevent dangling pointers
- **Stable Identifiers**: Handles remain valid across table modifications
- **Efficient Access**: O(1) lookup with sparse/dense table design
- **Memory Management**: Clear ownership semantics
- **Lazy Invalidation**: Safe access through handle validation

**Benefits:**

- Eliminates use-after-free errors common in direct pointer systems
- Provides stable identifiers that persist across scene modifications
- Enables efficient resource table reorganization without invalidating client code

#### 2. SafeCall Pattern

**Error Handling Implementation:**

```cpp
template<typename Func>
auto SafeCall(Func&& func) const -> decltype(func()) {
    if (auto scene = m_scene.lock()) {
        if (auto impl = scene->m_nodeTable->Get(m_handle)) {
            return func();
        }
    }
    return decltype(func()){}; // Safe default
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Exception-free operation
- Graceful degradation on invalid access
- Consistent error behavior across the system
- Debug-friendly validation

#### 3. Component-Based Architecture

SceneNodeImpl inherits from Composition, providing complete component management:

**Core Components (Added at Construction):**

- **ObjectMetaData**: Node names and properties
- **NodeData**: Scene flags storage
- **GraphData**: Hierarchy relationships (parent, children, siblings)
- **TransformComponent**: TRS transformation data
- **Camera**: Perspective or Orthographic camera

**Runtime Component API (Available Now):**

```cpp
// Component attachment after construction
template<IsComponent T, typename... Args>
auto AddComponent(Args&&... args) -> T&;

template<typename T>
auto GetComponent() const -> T&;

template<typename T>
auto HasComponent() const -> bool;

template<typename T>
void RemoveComponent();

template<typename OldT, typename NewT, typename... Args>
auto ReplaceComponent(Args&&... args) -> NewT&;
```

**Advanced Features:**

- **Component Dependencies**: Components can declare dependencies via ClassDependencies()
- **Thread Safety**: All operations protected by mutex
- **Deep Cloning**: CloneableMixin supports component-aware deep copying
- **Iteration Support**: Range-based iteration over all components
- **Validation**: Automatic dependency validation and enforcement

**Benefits:**

- **Full Extensibility**: Can attach arbitrary components (Camera, Mesh, Light) at runtime
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time type validation with concepts
- **Performance**: Direct component access, no virtual dispatch overhead
- **Memory Safety**: RAII with automatic cleanup
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic dependency resolution and validation

**Example Usage:**

```cpp
// SceneNodeImpl already provides this API!
auto& camera = scene_node_impl.AddComponent<CameraComponent>(fov, aspect_ratio);
auto& mesh = scene_node_impl.AddComponent<MeshComponent>(mesh_resource);
auto& light = scene_node_impl.AddComponent<DirectionalLight>(direction, color);

if (scene_node_impl.HasComponent<CameraComponent>()) {
    auto& cam = scene_node_impl.GetComponent<CameraComponent>();
    cam.SetFieldOfView(new_fov);
}
```

#### 4. Type Erasure Pattern

**Implementation Strategy:** Complex template method implementations are moved
to .cpp files using type erasure to maintain header cleanliness while preserving
performance.

```cpp
// Header: Simple wrapper
template <typename BatchFunc>
auto ExecuteBatch(BatchFunc&& batch_func) const noexcept -> BatchResult {
  return ExecuteBatchImpl(std::function<void(const SceneQuery&)>
    std::forward<BatchFunc>(batch_func)));
}

// .cpp: Full implementation
auto ExecuteBatchImpl(std::function<void(const SceneQuery&)> batch_func) const noexcept
  -> BatchResult {
  // 20+ lines of complex orchestration logic
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **Header Bloat Prevention**: Complex logic hidden from compilation units
- **Compilation Speed**: Reduced template instantiation overhead
- **Maintainability**: Implementation changes don't require client recompilation
- **Performance**: Negligible runtime cost (~2-5 CPU cycles per operation)

#### 5. Visitor and Filter Patterns

**Traversal and Query Architecture:**

```cpp
template <typename Visitor, typename SceneT>
concept SceneVisitorT = requires(Visitor v,
  const VisitedNodeT<std::is_const_v<SceneT>>& visited_node,
  bool dry_run) {
  { v(visited_node, dry_run) } -> std::convertible_to<VisitResult>;
};

template <typename Filter, typename SceneT>
concept SceneFilterT = requires(Filter f,
  const VisitedNodeT<std::is_const_v<SceneT>>& visited_node,
  FilterResult parent_result) {
  { f(visited_node, parent_result) } -> std::convertible_to<FilterResult>;
};
```

**Key Features:**

- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of visitor and filter types
- **Flexibility**: Support for lambda visitors and custom filter implementations
- **Performance**: Zero-overhead abstractions with concept-based validation
- **Composability**: Filters and visitors can be combined and chained

#### 6. RAII and Resource Safety Pattern

**Ownership and Lifetime Management:**

```cpp
class SceneNode : public Resource<resources::kSceneNode, NodeHandle> {
private:
  std::weak_ptr<const Scene> scene_weak_ {};
  // Safe access through weak pointer validation
};

class Scene {
private:
  std::shared_ptr<ResourceTable<SceneNodeImpl>> node_table_;
  // Automatic cleanup on destruction
};
```

**Safety Guarantees:**

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Resources freed automatically when scenes are destroyed
- **Weak Reference Validation**: Scene access validated before node operations
- **Exception Safety**: RAII ensures consistent state even during exceptions
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Smart pointers eliminate manual memory management

#### 7. Const Correctness Pattern

**Compile-Time Immutability:**

```cpp
// Automatic const deduction based on Scene type
template <typename SceneT>
class SceneTraversal {
public:
  using VisitedNode = VisitedNodeT<std::is_const_v<SceneT>>;
  // ConstVisitedNode for const Scene, MutableVisitedNode for Scene
};

// Const-correct query operations
template <std::predicate<const ConstVisitedNode&> Predicate>
auto FindFirst(Predicate&& predicate) const noexcept -> std::optional<SceneNode>;
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**

- **Template Specialization**: `SceneTraversal<const Scene>` for read-only operations
- **Automatic Type Deduction**: Visitor node types determined by Scene constness
- **Concept Validation**: Compile-time enforcement of const correctness
- **API Design**: Clear separation between querying and modification operations

#### 8. Deferred Computation Pattern

**Lazy Evaluation Strategy:**

```cpp
class TransformComponent {
    mutable Mat4 world_matrix_{1.0f};           // Cached world transform
    mutable bool is_dirty_ = true;              // Dirty tracking

    auto GetWorldMatrix() const -> const Mat4& {
        if (is_dirty_) {
            UpdateWorldMatrix(); // Compute only when needed
        }
        return world_matrix_;
    }
};
```

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Lazy Matrix Computation**: World transforms computed only when accessed
- **Dirty Tracking**: Only modified nodes processed during updates
- **Hierarchical Pruning**: Clean subtrees completely skipped
- **Batch Processing**: Related operations grouped for cache efficiency

#### 9. Two-Pass Update Cycle Pattern

**Implemented Update System:**

```cpp
void Scene::Update(bool skip_dirty_flags) noexcept {
    if (!skip_dirty_flags) {
        ProcessDirtyFlags(*this);      // Pass 1: Linear flag processing
    }
    UpdateTransforms();                // Pass 2: Hierarchical transform updates
}
```

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Cache Locality**: Flag processing in linear pass over all nodes
- **Dependency Resolution**: Flags processed before transforms to ensure consistency
- **Batch Operations**: Related updates grouped together for efficiency
- **Hierarchical Pruning**: Clean subtrees completely skipped during transform updates

### Pattern Integration

These patterns work synergistically to create a cohesive system:

1. **Handle/View + RAII**: Safe resource access with automatic cleanup
2. **Visitor + Const Correctness**: Type-safe, immutable traversal operations
3. **Type Erasure + Deferred Computation**: Clean APIs with optimal performance
4. **Component Architecture + SafeCall**: Extensible design with robust error handling

This combination ensures both high performance and maintainable code while
providing safety guarantees essential for production game engine development.

---

## Performance Architecture

The Scene system's performance architecture is designed around key principles
that work together to achieve high throughput and low latency for typical game
engine workloads.

### Memory Layout Optimization

**Cache-Friendly Design:**

1. **Dense Storage**: ResourceTable packs data for iteration efficiency
2. **Component Locality**: Related data stored together for spatial locality
3. **SIMD Alignment**: Transform data 16-byte aligned for vectorized operations
4. **Minimal Indirection**: Single-level handle lookup reduces pointer chasing

**Memory Efficiency Characteristics:**

- No fragmentation from node creation/destruction via ResourceTable
- Sparse table automatically reuses deleted slots
- Dense table maintains cache locality during traversals
- Per-node memory overhead: ~152 bytes total (4 components + handle overhead)

### Computational Efficiency

**Lazy Evaluation Strategy:**

- **Transform Matrices**: Computed only when accessed, respecting cache patterns
- **Dirty Tracking**: Only modified nodes processed during updates
- **Hierarchical Pruning**: Clean subtrees completely skipped in updates
- **Batch Processing**: Related operations grouped for cache efficiency

**Two-Pass Update Cycle:**

The system uses a sophisticated two-pass update algorithm optimizing for both
cache locality and dependency resolution:

```cpp
void Scene::Update() {
    ProcessDirtyFlags(*this);      // Pass 1: Linear scan for flags
    UpdateTransformsIterative(*this); // Pass 2: Hierarchical DFS for transforms
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **Cache Locality**: Linear pass processes all flags contiguously
- **Dependency Resolution**: Flags processed before transforms
- **Batch Operations**: Related updates grouped together
- **Hierarchical Pruning**: Clean subtrees skipped entirely

### Algorithmic Complexity

**Performance Guarantees:**

- **Node Access**: O(1) via handle lookup in resource table
- **Scene Updates**: O(dirty_nodes) for processing, not O(total_nodes)
- **Tree Traversal**: O(nodes) with early termination optimizations
- **Flag Processing**: O(total_dirty_flags) linear scan
- **Query Operations**: O(nodes) with user-controlled early termination

### Scalability Characteristics

**Update Performance Scaling:**

- Linear scaling with dirty node count, not total scene size
- Independent of total scene size for clean subtrees
- Efficient parent-before-child processing order
- Optimized flag propagation with minimal overhead

**Query System Performance:**

- High-performance, zero-copy queries with early termination
- User-controlled memory allocation eliminates forced allocations
- Batch execution enables N queries in 1 traversal instead of N traversals
- Const-correct design ensures compile-time immutability guarantees

### Performance Metrics

**Current Performance Characteristics:**

- **Node Access**: ~5-10 CPU cycles (O(1) lookup)
- **Scene Update**: ~100-500 ¬µs for 10K nodes (90% clean)
- **Memory Usage**: ~150-200 bytes per node average
- **Cache Miss Rate**: <5% for linear operations

**Target Performance Goals:**

- **Large Scenes**: 100K+ nodes with <10ms update time
- **Memory Efficiency**: <128 bytes per node average
- **Multi-threading**: 4-8x speedup on 8-core systems (planned)
- **Cache Performance**: <2% miss rate for hot paths

## Gap Analysis & Limitations

### Current Implementation Gaps

#### Critical Missing Infrastructure

1. **Mesh/Renderable and Light Components**
    - **Missing Capabilities**: No rendering or lighting components implemented yet.
    - **Impact**: Scene graph cannot be visualized or rendered; blocks integration with renderer and content pipeline.
    - **Priority**: Highest. These are the next features to implement, as they unlock rendering and engine integration.

2. Serialization Infrastructure
    - **Missing Capabilities**: Scene save/load functionality, node state
      persistence, hierarchy restoration, cross-session compatibility
    - **Impact**: Limits content pipeline integration and scene persistence
    - **Priority**: Deferred. Not urgent due to presence of TestSceneFactory and current focus on rendering.

3. Multi-threading Support
    - **Current Limitations**: Single-threaded update cycle, no parallel
      transform processing, sequential flag propagation, synchronization
      primitives absent
    - **Impact**: Cannot leverage multi-core systems for large scenes

4. Advanced Culling Integration
    - **Missing Systems**: Frustum culling integration, occlusion culling
      support, LOD system integration, spatial partitioning
    - **Impact**: Performance limitations for complex scenes with many objects

5. Event System Architecture
    - **Missing Infrastructure**: Node change notifications, hierarchy
      modification events, property change callbacks, observer pattern
      implementation
    - **Impact**: Difficult to build reactive systems on top of scene graph

### Design Limitations

#### System Constraints

1. Flag System Constraints

    - **Current Limitations**: Maximum 6 flags currently defined, supports up to
      12 flags with 5-bit layout
    - **Fixed Flag Definition**: Flags defined at compile-time only (kVisible,
      kStatic, kCastsShadows, kReceivesShadows, kRayCastingSelectable,
      kIgnoreParentTransform)
    - **No Runtime Expansion**: Cannot define new flags without modifying
      SceneNodeFlags enum
    - **Limited Atomic Operations**: Basic flag operations but no advanced
      atomicity guarantees

2. Transform System Restrictions

    - **Missing Features**: Coordinate space conversion utilities, transform
      constraints and validation, non-uniform scaling edge cases, advanced
      interpolation methods

3. Memory Management

    - **ResourceTable Constraints**: Fixed initial capacity (1024), automatic
      growth handled internally
    - **Component Composition**: Full Composition system supports unlimited
      runtime components
    - **Handle Overhead**: Stable but requires weak_ptr validation on every
      access
    - **Memory Pool Integration**: Not implemented - uses standard allocators
    - **Component Dependencies**: Dependency validation adds slight overhead but
      ensures correctness

---

## Enhancement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Rendering Component Implementations (Highest Priority)

**Rationale:**

The component system infrastructure is complete and robust. The most urgent next step is to implement the Mesh/Renderable and Light components, enabling actual scene rendering and visual output. This will unlock the ability to test, validate, and demonstrate the scene system in real-world rendering scenarios. Serialization and other infrastructure are deferred until after rendering support is in place.

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Implement Mesh/Renderable and Light components as first-class scene components.
- Integrate with the existing component attachment, dependency, and update systems.
- Ensure type-safe APIs and support for runtime attachment/detachment.
- Provide basic test coverage and documentation for new components.

**Benefits:**

- Enables rendering of scene content (geometry, lighting) for the first time.
- Validates the extensibility and performance of the component system.
- Provides a foundation for further rendering, culling, and visibility features.

**Timeline:** 1-2 months per component type (Mesh, Light)

### Priority 2: Serialization Infrastructure (Deferred)

- Design and implement scene save/load with component-aware serialization.
- Integrate with the Composition system for automatic component serialization.
- Add versioning and migration support for future compatibility.
- Timeline: After rendering components are functional and tested.

### Priority 3: Performance Optimization and Feature Extensions

- Multi-threading support for update and traversal (after rendering is in place).
- Event system for notifications and editor integration.
- Spatial partitioning and culling systems for rendering optimization.
- Animation system bridge for transform/scene animation.
- Quality-of-life tools and utility extensions.

---

## Conclusion

The Oxygen Engine Scene System provides a mature, extensible, and high-performance foundation for 3D scene management. With the core architecture, component system, and camera support complete, the immediate next step is to implement Mesh/Renderable and Light components. This will enable rendering, unlock further system validation, and provide a basis for future enhancements such as serialization, multi-threading, and advanced culling. The system is well-positioned for production use and further growth.
