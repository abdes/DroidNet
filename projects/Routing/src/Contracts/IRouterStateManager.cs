    /// When trying to match a URL to a route, the router looks at the

    /// matching URL segments with paths, having to backtrack sometimes to
    /// continue trying the next routes if the current one fails to match. This
    /// means that the first path of routes to fully consume a URL wins. You
    /// must take care with how you structure your router configuration, as
    /// there is no notion of specificity or importance amongst routes â€” the
    /// first match always wins. Order matters. Once all segments of the URL
    /// have been consumed, we say that a match has occurred.
