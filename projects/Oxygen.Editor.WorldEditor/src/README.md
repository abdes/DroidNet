# Oxygen World Editor

The game engine world editor is a vital tool in game development, enabling
developers to design and manage virtual environments. Within a world editor,
developers can create and sculpt terrains, place and manipulate objects, and
adjust lighting and environmental settings to craft immersive worlds. They can
import and organize assets, write and attach scripts to define object behaviors,
and set up event triggers. The editor allows for real-time playtesting and
debugging, ensuring smooth gameplay. Developers can also customize the user
interface for efficiency, optimize performance with tools for detailed geometry,
and manage resources effectively.
